  abstract = {The Rayleigh-Plateau instability occurs when surface tension makes a fluid column become unstable to small perturbations. At nanometer scales, thermal fluctuations are comparable to surface energy densities. Consequently, at these scales, thermal fluctuations play a significant role in the dynamics of the instability. These microscopic effects have previously been investigated numerically using particle-based simulations, such as molecular dynamics, and stochastic partial differential equation based hydrodynamic models, such as stochastic lubrication theory. In this paper we present an incompressible fluctuating hydrodynamics model with a diffuse-interface formulation for binary fluid mixtures designed for the study of stochastic interfacial phenomena. An efficient numerical algorithm is outlined and validated in numerical simulations of stable equilibrium interfaces. We present results from simulations of the Rayleigh-Plateau instability for long cylinders pinching into droplets for Ohnesorge numbers of Oh = 0.5 and 5.0. Both stochastic and perturbed deterministic simulations are analyzed and ensemble results show significant differences in the temporal evolution of the minimum radius near pinching. Short cylinders, with lengths less than their circumference, were also investigated. As previously observed in molecular dynamics simulations, we find that thermal fluctuations cause these to pinch in cases where a perturbed cylinder would be stable deterministically. Finally we show that the fluctuating hydrodynamics model can be applied to study a broader range of surface-tension driven phenomena.},

Consequently, efficient computational techniques that allow for a direct comparison with experiment become increasingly important. Here we demonstrate, for the first time, that the full complex spatial and temporal evolution of the rupture of ultrathin films can be modelled in quantitative agreement with experiment. We accomplish this by combining highly controlled experiments on different film-rupture patterns with computer simulations using novel numerical schemes for thin-film equations. For the quantitative comparison of the pattern evolution in both experiment and simulation we introduce a novel pattern analysis method based on Minkowski measures. Our results are fundamental for the development of efficient tools capable of describing essential aspects of thin-film flow in technical systems.},

  abstract = {Wetting phenomena are ubiquitous in nature and technology. A solid substrate exposed to the environment is almost invariably covered by a layer of fluid material. In this review, the surface forces that lead to wetting are considered, and the equilibrium surface coverage of a substrate in contact with a drop of liquid. Depending on the nature of the surface forces involved, different scenarios for wetting phase transitions are possible; recent progress allows us to relate the critical exponents directly to the nature of the surface forces which lead to the different wetting scenarios. Thermal fluctuation effects, which can be greatly enhanced for wetting of geometrically or chemically structured substrates, and are much stronger in colloidal suspensions, modify the adsorption singularities. Macroscopic descriptions and microscopic theories have been developed to understand and predict wetting behavior relevant to microfluidics and nanofluidics applications. Then the dynamics of wetting is examined. A drop, placed on a substrate which it wets, spreads out to form a film. Conversely, a nonwetted substrate previously covered by a film dewets upon an appropriate change of system parameters. The hydrodynamics of both wetting and dewetting is influenced by the presence of the three-phase contact line separating ``wet'' regions from those that are either dry or covered by a microscopic film only. Recent theoretical, experimental, and numerical progress in the description of moving contact line dynamics are reviewed, and its relation to the thermodynamics of wetting is explored. In addition, recent progress on rough surfaces is surveyed. The anchoring of contact lines and contact angle hysteresis are explored resulting from surface inhomogeneities. Further, new ways to mold wetting characteristics according to technological constraints are discussed, for example, the use of patterned surfaces, surfactants, or complex fluids.},

Moreover, the thermal-responsive wettability and adhesion to oil at the water/solid interface can be tailored by designing and constructing ordered micro-structures on the surface. We demonstrated the thermal-responsive changing of the topography on PNIPAM hydrogel surface by atomic force microscopy and proposed a mechanism of inter-molecular to intra-molecular hydrogen binding transitions.

Thin film flows occur over a wide range of length scales and are central to numerous areas of engineering, geophysics, and biophysics; these include nanofluidics and microfluidics, coating flows, intensive processing, lava flows, dynamics of continental ice sheets, tear-film rupture, and surfactant replacement therapy. These flows have attracted considerable attention in the literature, which have resulted in many significant developments in experimental, analytical, and numerical research in this area. These include advances in understanding dewetting, thermocapillary- and surfactant-driven films, falling films and films flowing over structured, compliant, and rapidly rotating substrates, and evaporating films as well as those manipulated via use of electric fields to produce nanoscale patterns. These developments are reviewed in this paper and open problems and exciting research avenues in this thriving area of fluid mechanics are also highlighted.},

These techniques can be used to visualize and better understand the origins of defects in these coatings on a microscopic scale, as well as for mapping and counting defect density on a macroscopic scale (tens of cm2 or more).},

  abstract = {Lattice Boltzmann equations for the isothermal Navier-Stokes equations have been constructed systematically using a truncated moment expansion of the equilibrium distribution function from continuum kinetic theory. Applied to the shallow water equations, with its different equation of state, the same approach yields discrete equilibria that are subject to a grid scale computational instability. Different and stable equilibria were previously constructed by Salmon [J. Marine Res. 57, 503 (1999)]. The two sets of equilibria differ through a nonhydrodynamic or ``ghost'' mode that has no direct effect on the hydrodynamic behavior derived in the slowly varying limit. However, Salmon's equilibria eliminate a coupling between hydrodynamic and ghost modes, one that leads to instability with a growth rate increasing with wave number. Previous work has usually assumed that truncated moment expansions lead to stable schemes. Such instabilities have implications for lattice Boltzmann equations that simulate other nonideal equations of state, or that simulate fully compressible, nonisothermal fluids using additional particles.},

By isolating the effect of van der Waals interactions for nanoscale rivulets, and of gravity for macrosize rivulets, we are able to analyze the influence of these forces on the stability. We discuss in detail the scaling of the emerging wavelengths (distance between drops formed after the breakup process) with the rivulet cross-sectional area. Perhaps surprisingly, we uncover close connection between this scaling and the one for the breakup of a free-space fluid jet (Rayleigh--Plateau instability). Finally, we consider rivulets of finite length and find that the finite size effects are considerably different from the ones obtained previously for semi-infinite fluid films.},

We find the stability regions for given area of the cross section of the rivulet, A, plane inclination angle, {$\alpha$}, and static contact angle, {\texttheta}0, characterizing the wettability of the substrate. For {$\alpha$}'s smaller than some critical angle, {$\alpha$}*, a static solution exists. This solution is characterized by rear/front contact angles given by {\texttheta}0 {\textpm} {$\delta$}. The linear stability analysis of this solution is performed using an efficient pseudo-spectral Chebyshev method. We analyze the effects of A, {\texttheta}0, and {$\alpha$} on the predictions of the model, such as the dominant wavelength, the maximum growth rate, and the behavior of the most unstable perturbation mode. To verify them, we also carry out experiments with silicone oils spreading on a coated glass substrate for several different fluid volumes and inclination angles. We find very good agreement between the wavelength of maximum growth rate given by the theory and the average distance between the drops after rivulet breakup. An analysis of finite size effects shows that the inclusion of normal gravity effects leads to a better agreement between theoretical and experimental results.},

  abstract = {Wetting and dewetting are both fundamental modes of motion of liquids on solid surfaces. They are critically important for processes in biology, chemistry, and engineering, such as drying, coating, and lubrication. However, recent progress in wetting, which has led to new fields such as superhydrophobicity and liquid marbles, has not been matched by dewetting. A significant problem has been the inability to study the model system of a uniform film dewetting from a nonwetting surface to a single macroscopic droplet---a barrier that does not exist for the reverse wetting process of a droplet spreading into a film. We report the dewetting of a dielectrophoresis-induced film into a single equilibrium droplet. The emergent picture of the full dewetting dynamics is of an initial regime, where a liquid rim recedes at constant speed and constant dynamic contact angle, followed by a relatively short exponential relaxation of a spherical cap shape. This sharply contrasts with the reverse wetting process, where a spreading droplet follows a smooth sequence of spherical cap shapes. Complementary numerical simulations and a hydrodynamic model reveal a local dewetting mechanism driven by the equilibrium contact angle, where contact line slip dominates the dewetting dynamics. Our conclusions can be used to understand a wide variety of processes involving liquid dewetting, such as drop rebound, condensation, and evaporation. In overcoming the barrier to studying single film-to-droplet dewetting, our results provide new approaches to fluid manipulation and uses of dewetting, such as inducing films of prescribed initial shapes and slip-controlled liquid retraction.},

Hence experimental studies visualize and characterize the increase in size over time for drops spreading over substrates, or liquid bridges between coalescing drops, or the decrease in the radius of pinching necks during drop formation. Even for Newtonian fluids, the interplay of inertial, viscous, and capillary stresses can lead to a number of scaling laws, with three limiting self-similar cases: visco-inertial (VI), visco-capillary (VC) and inertio-capillary (IC). Though experiments are presented as examples of the methods of dimensional analysis, the lack of precise values or estimates for pre-factors, transitions, and scaling exponents presents difficulties for quantitative analysis and material characterization. In this tutorial review, we reanalyze and summarize an elaborate set of landmark published experimental studies on a wide range of Newtonian fluids. We show that moving beyond VI, VC, and IC units in favor of intrinsic timescale and lengthscale determined by all three material properties (viscosity, surface tension and density), creates a complementary system that we call the Ohnesorge units. We find that in spite of large differences in topological features, timescales, and material properties, the analysis of spreading, pinching and coalescing drops in the Ohnesorge units results in a remarkable collapse of the experimental datasets, highlighting the shared and universal features displayed in such flows.},

  abstract = {To characterize nontrivial boundary conditions of a liquid flowing past a solid, the slip length is commonly used as a measure. From the profile of a retracting liquid front (e.g., measured with atomic force microscopy), the slip length can be extracted with the help of a Stokes model for a thin liquid film dewetting from a solid substrate. Specifically, we use a lubrication model derived from the Stokes model for strong slippage and linearize the film profile around the flat, unperturbed film. For small slip lengths, we expand the linearized full Stokes model for small slopes up to third order. Using the respective model, we obtain, in addition to the slip length, the capillary number, from which we can estimate the viscosity of the fluid film. We compare numerical and experimental results, test the consistency and the validity of the models/approximations, and give an easy-to-follow guide of how they can be used to analyze experiments.},

  abstract = {This critical review is motivated by an increasing interest of the microfluidics community in developing complete Lab-on-a-Chip solutions based on thin and flexible films (Lab-on-a-Foil). Those implementations benefit from a broad range of fabrication methods that are partly adopted from well-established macroscale processes or are completely new and promising. In addition, thin and flexible foils enable various features like low thermal resistance for efficient thermocycling or integration of easily deformable chambers paving the way for new means of on-chip reagent storage or fluid transport. From an economical perspective, Lab-on-a-Foil systems are characterised by low material consumption and often low-cost materials which are attractive for cost-effective high-volume fabrication of self-contained disposable chips. The first part of this review focuses on available materials, fabrication processes and approaches for integration of microfluidic functions including liquid control and transport as well as storage and release of reagents. In the second part, an analysis of the state of Lab-on-a-Foil applications is provided with a special focus on nucleic acid analysis, immunoassays, cell-based assays and home care testing. We conclude that the Lab-on-a-Foil approach is very versatile and significantly expands the toolbox for the development of Lab-on-a-Chip solutions.},

We discuss the conditions under which a static equilibrium of the ring is possible in the presence of contact angle hysteresis. A linear stability analysis (LSA) of this equilibrium solution is carried out by using a slip model to account for the contact line divergence. The LSA provides specific predictions regarding the evolution of unstable modes. In order to describe the evolution of the ring for longer times, a quasi-static approximation is implemented. This approach assumes a quasi-static evolution and takes into account the concomitant variation of the instantaneous growth rates of the modes responsible for either collapse of the ring into a single central drop or breakup into a number of droplets along the ring periphery. We compare the results of the LSA and the quasi-static model approach with those obtained from nonlinear numerical simulations using a complementary disjoining pressure model. We find remarkably good agreement between the predictions of the two models regarding the expected number of drops forming during the breakup process.},

To study such cases, we implement the boundary-element method to solve the governing Stokes equations for the fluid flow field inside and on the surface of a droplet and supplement it by the Cox--Voinov law for the dynamics of the contact line. Our approach reproduces the relaxation of an axisymmetric droplet in experiments, which we initiate by instantaneously switching the uniform wettability of a substrate quantified by the equilibrium contact angle. In a step profile of wettability the droplet moves towards higher wettability. Using a feedback loop to keep the distance or offset between step and droplet center constant, induces a constant velocity with which the droplet surfs on the wettability step. We analyze the velocity in terms of droplet offset and step width for typical wetting parameters. Moving instead the wettability step with constant speed, we determine the maximally possible droplet velocities under various conditions. The observed droplet speeds agree with the values from the feedback study for the same positive droplet offset.},

Tribology, the theory and practice of lubrication, is a broad subject, the exhaustive treatment of which would include thorough consideration both of the variety of mechanisms of lubrication and of bearing types. The treatment here is limited to those continuum fluid films, called simply ''films,'' which are associated with slider, journal, and sector thrust bearings. Considerable attention is given to incompressible films because films are often effectively incompressible. Thin film and boundary lubrication, the other important mechanisms of lubrication, are not examined here. There is a special focus upon gas lubrication.},

Adherence is required except at the contact line itself. Though the velocity field appears to be realistic, stresses and viscous dissipation are found to increase without bound at the contact line. The way the hydrodynamic model breaks down suggests that in reality there may be steep gradients, rheological anomalies, and discontinuous processes around the contact line.

In this review, we have emphasized on and summarized the most recent observations and efforts in the progress of photoswitchable spiropyran-based materials and their applications as sensors for heavy metal cations, anions, pH, acid and base vapors, wettability and humidity.

The bio-based field is another interesting subject that is discussed here and consists of reversible cell sheet engineering, photodynamic therapy, switchable fluorescence labeling, controlled drug delivery and biological ion channels. On the other hand, limited light penetration inside the living tissues and hazards of high-energy ultraviolet irradiation for initiating photochemical transformations have limited the use of such light-controlled systems in medicinal and therapeutic means. Those spiropyran-based materials which are susceptible to being triggered by low energy near IR (NIR) two-photon light irradiation and upconversion nanoparticles are recently under serious explorations and have been reviewed as a new perspective for their advanced applications.},

We find that for non-zero contact angles there is a finite range of perturbation wavenumbers in the axial direction which correspond to instability and will potentially lead to agglomeration of the line of film. All unstable perturbations are of the varicose (sausage) type. The presence of the substrate is stabilizing; the range of unstable wavelengths is always less than that of a freely-suspended circular cylinder with the same volume and decreases to zero width at zero contact angle. The maximum growth rate of the instability varies strongly with the contact angle and approaches zero as the contact angle approaches zero. Our results agree qualitatively with the experimentally observed wavelength and growth rates of the instability.},

We show that the capillary wave initially grows linearly as on a straight thread. The axial curvature decreases the growth rate of the capillary waves while the external flow enhances it. Breakup depends on the competition of two time scales: one for torus retraction and the other for neck pinch-off. The outcome is determined by the initial amplitude of the disturbance, the thickness of the torus relative to its circumference, and the torus-to-medium viscosity ratio. The linearly dominant mode may not persist till nonlinear growth and breakup. The numerical results are generally consistent with experimental observations.},

We focus on the nonlinear instabilities that appear as roll waves. Roll waves are generated by perturbing a permanent flow of Herschel--Bulkley fluid (Carbopol 980) at low frequencies. To determine the local thickness of the film, we used a laser sensor and a camera to globally capture the transverse shape of the waves. For a regular forcing, the results show the existence of different regimes. First, we observe primary instabilities below the cut-off frequency at the entrance of the channel. After the exponential growth of the wave in the linear regime, we recognise the nonlinear dynamics with the existence of finite amplitude waves. This finite amplitude depends on the frequency, the Reynolds number and the inclination angle. The results show that this instability is supercritical. At moderate Reynolds numbers, the finite 2-D waves become sensitive to transverse perturbations, due to a secondary instability, and become 3-D waves. The experimental results illustrate a phenomenology of viscoplastic film flows similar to Newtonian fluids, except for the capillary waves.},

We studied various fundamental and applied aspects of equilibrium liquid surface morphologies both theoretically and experimentally. Our theoretical analysis showed that surface profiles on homogeneous surfaces display a diverging curvature in the vicinity of the three phase contact line. The asymptotic contact angle at the contact line is equal to Young's angle, independent of the applied voltage. With respect to the morphology of the liquid surface, contact angle variations achieved by electrowetting are equivalent to those achieved by varying the chemical nature of the substrates, except for electric field-induced distortions in a region close to the contact line. Experimentally, we studied the (global) morphology of liquid microstructure substrates with stripe-shaped electrodes. As the local contact angle is reduced by increasing the applied voltage, liquid droplets elongate along the stripe axis as expected. For droplets on a single surface with a stripe electrode, there is a discontinuous morphological transition where elongated droplets transform into translationally invariant cylinder segments with the contact line pinned along the stripe edge and vice versa. If the liquid is confined between two parallel surfaces with parallel stripe electrodes, the elongation of the droplet and its transformation into a translationally invariant morphology with pinned contact lines is continuous. Experimental results are compared to analytical and numerical models.},

Specifically, the influence of slip on the dewetting behavior of fluids on hydrophobic substrates is investigated here. Matched asymptotics are used to describe the dynamic profiles for dewetting films and comparison is given with computational simulations. The motion of the dewetting front shows transitions from being nearly linear in time for no-slip to t2/3 as the slip is increased. For much larger slip lengths the front motion appears to become linear again. Correspondingly, the dewetting profiles undergo a transition from oscillatory to monotone decay into the uniform film layer for large slip. Increasing the slip further, to very large values, is associated with an increasing degree of asymmetry in the structure of the dewetting ridge profile},

  abstract = {Macroscopic thin liquid films are entities that are important in biophysics, physics, and engineering, as well as in natural settings. They can be composed of common liquids such as water or oil, rheologically complex materials such as polymers solutions or melts, or complex mixtures of phases or components. When the films are subjected to the action of various mechanical, thermal, or structural factors, they display interesting dynamic phenomena such as wave propagation, wave steepening, and development of chaotic responses. Such films can display rupture phenomena creating holes, spreading of fronts, and the development of fingers. In this review a unified mathematical theory is presented that takes advantage of the disparity of the length scales and is based on the asymptotic procedure of reduction of the full set of governing equations and boundary conditions to a simplified, highly nonlinear, evolution equation or to a set of equations. As a result of this long-wave theory, a mathematical system is obtained that does not have the mathematical complexity of the original free-boundary problem but does preserve many of the important features of its physics. The basics of the long-wave theory are explained. If, in addition, the Reynolds number of the flow is not too large, the analogy with Reynolds's theory of lubrication can be drawn. A general nonlinear evolution equation or equations are then derived and various particular cases are considered. Each case contains a discussion of the linear stability properties of the base-state solutions and of the nonlinear spatiotemporal evolution of the interface (and other scalar variables, such as temperature or solute concentration). The cases reducing to a single highly nonlinear evolution equation are first examined. These include: (a) films with constant interfacial shear stress and constant surface tension, (b) films with constant surface tension and gravity only, (c) films with van der Waals (long-range molecular) forces and constant surface tension only, (d) films with thermocapillarity, surface tension, and body force only, (e) films with temperature-dependent physical properties, (f) evaporating/condensing films, (g) films on a thick substrate, (h) films on a horizontal cylinder, and (i) films on a rotating disc. The dynamics of the films with a spatial dependence of the base-state solution are then studied. These include the examples of nonuniform temperature or heat flux at liquid-solid boundaries. Problems which reduce to a set of nonlinear evolution equations are considered next. Those include (a) the dynamics of free liquid films, (b) bounded films with interfacial viscosity, and (c) dynamics of soluble and insoluble surfactants in bounded and free films. The spreading of drops on a solid surface and moving contact lines, including effects of heat and mass transport and van der Waals attractions, are then addressed. Several related topics such as falling films and sheets and Hele-Shaw flows are also briefly discussed. The results discussed give motivation for the development of careful experiments which can be used to test the theories and exhibit new phenomena.},

  abstract = {Thin polymer films on hydrophobic substrates are susceptible to rupture and hole formation. This, in turn, initiates a complex dewetting process, which ultimately leads to characteristic droplet patterns. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest that the type of droplet pattern depends on the specific interfacial condition between the polymer and the substrate. Predicting the morphological evolution over long timescales and on the different length scales involved is a major computational challenge. In this study, a highly adaptive numerical scheme is presented, which allows for following the dewetting process deep into the nonlinear regime of the model equations and captures the complex dynamics, including the shedding of droplets. In addition, our numerical results predict the previously unknown shedding of satellite droplets during the destabilization of liquid ridges that form during the late stages of the dewetting process. While the formation of satellite droplets is well known in the context of elongating fluid filaments and jets, we show here that, for dewetting liquid ridges, this property can be dramatically altered by the interfacial condition between polymer and substrate, namely slip. This work shows how dissipative processes can be used to systematically tune the formation of patterns.},

Such flows are governed by surface tension, inertia, stresses associated with the liquid rheology, and forces caused by the substrate's wettability. Instabilities of liquid bridges lead to the formation of finger-like structures on the substrate or the appearance of cavities at the wetted region of the wall.

The morphology has a strong influence on the performance of the final device but unfortunately, the process--structure relationship is often poorly and only qualitatively understood. This is because many different physical mechanisms (miscibility, evaporation, crystallization, diffusion, and advection) are active at potentially different time scales and because the kinetics plays a crucial role: the morphology develops until it is kinetically quenched far from equilibrium. In order to unravel the various possible structure formation pathways, a unified theoretical framework that takes into account all these physical phenomena is proposed. This phase-field simulation tool is based on the Cahn--Hilliard equations for diffusion and the Allen--Cahn equation for crystallization and evaporation, which are coupled to the equations for the dynamics of the fluid. The behavior of the coupled model based on simple test cases is discussed and verified. Furthermore, how this framework allows to investigate the morphology formation in a drying film undergoing evaporation-induced LLPS and crystallization, which is typically a situation encountered, is illustrated, for example, in organic photovoltaics applications.},

Herein, a phase-field simulation framework is proposed, handling liquid--liquid demixing and polycrystalline growth at the same time to investigate the evolution of crystalline immiscible binary systems. It is found that initially, the nuclei trigger the spinodal decomposition, whereas the growing crystals quench the phase coarsening in the amorphous mixture. In contrast, the separated liquid phases guide the crystal growth along the domains of high concentration. It is also demonstrated that with a higher crystallization rate, in the final morphology, single crystals are more structured and form percolating pathways for each material with smaller lateral dimensions.},

When the volume of the moving upper layer is sufficiently small, the motionless lower layer outcrops over a broad area of the northern wind gyre, and the pattern of separated and isolated western boundary currents agrees with the theory of Veronis (1973). Because planetary geostrophic dynamics omit inertia, lattice Boltzmann solutions of the planetary geostrophic equations do not require a lattice with the high degree of symmetry needed to correctly represent the Reynolds stress. This property gives planetary geostrophic dynamics a significant computational advantage over the primitive equations, especially in three dimensions.},

A great deal of effort has been devoted to improve and advance these devices with the goal of performing complete sets of biochemical assays on the device and possibly developing portable platforms for point of care applications. Among the different microfluidic systems used for such a purpose, digital microfluidics (DMF) shows high flexibility and capability of performing multiplex and parallel biochemical operations, and hence, has been considered as a suitable candidate for lab-on-a-chip applications. In this review, we discuss the most recent advances in the DMF platforms, and evaluate the feasibility of developing multifunctional packages for performing complete sets of processes of biochemical assays, particularly for point-of-care applications. The progress in the development of DMF systems is reviewed from eight different aspects, including device fabrication, basic fluidic operations, automation, manipulation of biological samples, advanced operations, detection, biological applications, and finally, packaging and portability of the DMF devices. Success in developing the lab-on-a-chip DMF devices will be concluded based on the advances achieved in each of these aspects.},

The deduced equations, which are verified by direct comparisons with numerical solutions to the governing equation, are scrutinized in a variety of dynamic and equilibrium settings. For example, we demonstrate the possibility for stick--slip dynamics, substrate-induced hysteresis, the uphill motion of the droplet for sufficiently strong chemical gradients and the existence of a critical inclination angle beyond which the droplet can no longer be supported at equilibrium. Where possible, analytical expressions are obtained for various quantities of interest, which are also verified by appropriate numerical experiments.},

An evolution equation is presented, using the lubrication approximation, that includes viscous, capillary, disjoining, and gravitational forces. Motion to and from dry substrate regions is made possible by use of a thin energetically stable wetting layer. Axisymmetric spreading on a uniform substrate is calculated, and it is found, in agreement with reported experiments, that spreading rates are independent of the contact angle until the drop has almost stabilized. We simulate motion on a heterogeneous substrate composed of two different materials having widely different contact angles. Motion proceeds in an almost discontinuous fashion as the initial droplet breaks up into smaller pieces through the action of the wetting forces. Various forms of the disjoining energy functional are employed; the particular choice is found to have only a limited quantitative effect of the drop dynamics. Experimental observations confirm the basic features of the simulation, although a time-scale correction needs to be applied.},

Here, inspired by the unique microstructure of plant stomata, we present a surface with programmable wettability arrays for droplets manipulation. The substrate film of this surface is constructed by using a coaxial capillary microfluidics to emulsify and pack graphene oxide (GO) hybrid N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) hydrogel solution into silica nanoparticles-dispersed ethoxylated trimethylolpropane triacrylate (ETPTA) phase. Because of the distribution of the silica nanoparticles on the ETPTA interface, the outer surface of the film could achieve favorable hydrophobic property under selective fluorosilane decoration. Owing to the outstanding photothermal energy transformation property of the GO, the encapsulated hydrophilic hydrogel arrays could shrink back into the holes to expose their hydrophobic surface with near-infrared (NIR) irradiation; this imparts the composite film with remotely switchable surface droplet adhesion status. Based on this phenomenon, we have demonstrated controllable droplet sliding on programmable wettability pathways, together with effective droplet transfer for printing with mask integration, which remains difficult to realize by existing techniques.},

The film stability, which depends on the film size and the wall wettability, is firstly predicted by a standard linear stability analysis (LSA) within the long-wave theoretical framework. We find that the film size plays the most important role in controlling the film stability. Specifically, the thinner the film is, the more sensitive it becomes to the large-wavenumber perturbation. The wall wettability mainly impacts the growth rates of perturbations and slightly influences the marginal stability and post-instability patterns of wrapping films. We compare the LSA predictions with numerical results obtained from a disjoining pressure model (DPM) and Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) simulations, which provide more insights into the film breakup process. At the early stage there is a strong agreement between the LSA predictions and the DPM results. Notably, as the perturbation grows, thin film regions connecting two neighboring satellite droplets form which may eventually lead to a stable or temporary secondary droplet, an aspect which the LSA is incapable of capturing. In addition, the VOF simulations suggest that beyond a critical film size the crest coalescence mechanism becomes involved during the breakup stage. Therefore, the LSA predictions are able to provide only an upper limit on the final number of satellite droplets.},

The three subfields of tribology - friction, lubrication, and wear - are strongly interrelated. The last decade has witnessed significant advances in the area of fluid film lubrication and its applications, and this second edition offers a look at some of these advances. This edition adds to the fundamentals of fluid film lubrication, a discourse on surface effects and the inclusion of treatment of flow with significant inertia within the section on turbulence. Basic ideas of the multigrid method are conveyed along with multilevel multi-integration in the treatment of elastohydrodynamic lubrication. New chapters have been included on ultra-thin films, both liquid and gaseous, and lubrication of articulating joints and their replacement. Some of the most recent literature is discussed.},

In the case of a receding non-volatile pure liquid the deposit might be a liquid film or an arrangement of droplets depending on the receding speed of the meniscus and the wetting properties of the system. For complex liquids with volatile components as, e.g., polymer solutions and particle or surfactant suspensions, the deposit might be a homogeneous or structured layer of solute --- with structures ranging from line patterns that can be orthogonal or parallel to the receding contact line via hexagonal or square arrangements of drops to complicated hierarchical structures. We review a number of recent experiments and modelling approaches with a particular focus on mesoscopic hydrodynamic long-wave models. The conclusion highlights open question and speculates about future developments.},

The article describes how simple microfluidic devices can be used to control fluid flow and produce a variety of new materials. Based on the concepts of coaxial flow and hydrodynamically focused flow, used alone or in various combinations, the devices can produce precisely controlled double emulsions (droplets within droplets) and even triple emulsions (double emulsions suspended in a third droplet). These structures, which can be created in a single microfluidic device, have various applications such as encapsulants for drugs, cosmetics, or food additives.}

  abstract = {Consider the spreading dynamics of a two-dimensional droplet over chemically heterogeneous substrates. Assuming small slopes and strong surface tension effects, a long-wave expansion of the Stokes equations yields a single evolution equation for the droplet thickness. The contact line singularity is removed by assuming slip at the liquid-solid interface. The chemical nature of the substrate is incorporated by local variations in the microscopic contact angle, which appear as boundary conditions in the governing equation. By asymptotically matching the flow in the bulk of the droplet with the flow in the vicinity of the contact lines, we obtain a set of coupled ordinary differential equations for the locations of the two droplet fronts. We verify the validity of our matching procedure by comparing the solutions of the ordinary differential equations with solutions of the full governing equation. The droplet dynamics is examined in detail via a phase-plane analysis. A number of interesting features that are not present in chemically homogeneous substrates are found, such as the existence of multiple equilibria, the pinning of the droplet fronts at localized chemical features, and the possibility for the droplet fronts to exhibit a stick-slip behavior.},

Reversible switching among multiple wetting states between superhydrophobicity and superhydrophilicity can be realized by synergistic regulation of surface microstructure based on stretching-recovery shape memory effect and surface chemical composition based on O2 plasma-heating. The mild and excellent water-responsive shape memory ability of substrate enables surface microstructure and corresponding wetting to fix at desirable states without keeping continuous external force or stimuli, which is superior to elastomer substrate, responsive molecule modification, or traditional temperature/light triggered shape memory materials. Given the flexibility and versatility, we show its applications in smart platform for creating gradient wettability and patterned micro-reaction.},

  abstract = {A droplet deposited on a solid substrate leads to the wetting phenomenon. A natural observation is the lotus effect, known for its superhydrophobicity. This special feature is engendered by the structured microstructure of the lotus leaf, namely, surface heterogeneity, as explained by the quintessential Cassie--Wenzel theory (CWT). In this work, recent designs of functional substrates are overviewed based on the CWT via manipulating the contact area between the liquid and the solid substrate as well as the intrinsic Young's contact angle. Moreover, the limitation of the CWT is discussed. When the droplet size is comparable to the surface heterogeneity, anisotropic wetting morphology often appears, which is beyond the scope of the Cassie--Wenzel work. In this case, several recent studies addressing the anisotropic wetting effect on chemically and mechanically patterned substrates are elucidated. Surface designs for anisotropic wetting morphologies are summarized with respect to the shape and the arrangement of the surface heterogeneity, the droplet volume, the deposition position of the droplet, as well as the mean curvature of the surface heterogeneity. A thermodynamic interpretation for the wetting effect and the corresponding open questions are presented at the end.},

  abstract = {The operation of a piezo inkjet printhead involves a chain of processes in many physical domains at different length scales. The final goal is the formation of droplets of all kinds of fluids with any desired volume, velocity, and a reliability as high as possible. The physics behind the chain of processes comprise the two-way coupling from the electrical to the mechanical domain through the piezoelectric actuator, where an electrical signal is transformed into a mechanical deformation of the printhead structure. The next two steps are the coupling to the acoustic domain inside the ink channels, and the coupling to the fluid dynamic domain, i.e.~the drop formation process. The dynamics of the printhead structure are coupled via the acoustics to the drop formation process in the nozzle. Furthermore, wetting of the nozzle plate and air bubbles can have a negative influence on the printhead performance. The five topics (actuation, channel acoustics, drop formation, wetting, and air bubbles) are reviewed in this paper. This research connects the product developments for many emerging new industrial applications of the inkjet technology to the fundamental physical phenomena underlying the printhead operation.},

However, above a certain size individual sliding drops are unstable and break up into smaller drops. Therefore, the long-time dynamics of a large drop ensemble is governed by a balance of merging and splitting. We employ a long-wave film height evolution equation and determine the dynamics of the drop size distribution towards a stationary state from direct numerical simulations on large domains. The main features of the distribution are then related to the bifurcation diagram of individual drops obtained by numerical path continuation. The gained knowledge allows us to develop a Smoluchowski-type statistical model for the ensemble dynamics that well compares to full direct simulations.},

The resultant length scale was correlated to the transport and instability growths that occur during the liquid lifetime of the melted copper rings. For 13-nm-thick rings, a change in the nanoparticle spacing with the ring width is attributed to a transition from a Raleigh-Plateau instability to a thin film instability because of competition between the cumulative transport and instability timescales. To explore the competition between instability mechanisms further, we carried out experiments with 7-nm-thick rings. In agreement with the theoretical predictions, these rings break up in both the azimuthal and radial directions, confirming that a simple hydrodynamic model captures the main features of the processes leading to the breakup.},

It is found that there are either one or two equilibrium shapes for a fixed ratio of d/V1/3 and each equilibrium shape corresponds to an energy minimum state. The aspect ratio of the droplets ? shows a periodic oscillation behavior with a decreasing amplitude as d/V1/3 decreases, similar to the stick?slip?jump movement of a slowly condensing droplet on a chemically striped patterned surface. Additionally, by comparing the movements of slowly evaporating and condensing droplets, we have observed a hysteresis phenomenon, which reveals that the final shapes of droplets also rely on the moving paths. Through modifying the dynamic contact angle boundary condition, the contact line movements of droplets under condensation and evaporation, which are far from equilibrium, are addressed.},

  abstract = {This critical review outlines the current state-of-the-art research on the reversibly switchable wettability of surface brought about by external stimuli and the exchange of counterions. Chemical composition and surface topography are the two key factors in the wettability of solid substrates. Applying external stimuli and exchanging counterions of ionic liquids and polyelectrolyte films are valuable approaches for rendering the change in surface chemistry and/or topography, and for driving the transition between hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of surfaces. Through the combination of stimuli-responsive films and micro-/nanostructural surfaces, smart surfaces with reversible switching between superhydrophobicity and superhydrophilicity have been achieved. As an important advancement in reversibly switchable wettability, this review briefly introduces ionic liquids (ILs) as on--off systems to obtain reversibly switchable wettability and then discusses in more detail the methods to induce the reversibly switchable wettability of surfaces modified by ILs, additives, or thin films. In addition to reversibly switchable wettability mechanisms, open problems and potential solutions are discussed (157 references).}
