  abstract = {The Rayleigh-Plateau instability occurs when surface tension makes a fluid column become unstable to small perturbations. At nanometer scales, thermal fluctuations are comparable to surface energy densities. Consequently, at these scales, thermal fluctuations play a significant role in the dynamics of the instability. These microscopic effects have previously been investigated numerically using particle-based simulations, such as molecular dynamics, and stochastic partial differential equation based hydrodynamic models, such as stochastic lubrication theory. In this paper we present an incompressible fluctuating hydrodynamics model with a diffuse-interface formulation for binary fluid mixtures designed for the study of stochastic interfacial phenomena. An efficient numerical algorithm is outlined and validated in numerical simulations of stable equilibrium interfaces. We present results from simulations of the Rayleigh-Plateau instability for long cylinders pinching into droplets for Ohnesorge numbers of Oh = 0.5 and 5.0. Both stochastic and perturbed deterministic simulations are analyzed and ensemble results show significant differences in the temporal evolution of the minimum radius near pinching. Short cylinders, with lengths less than their circumference, were also investigated. As previously observed in molecular dynamics simulations, we find that thermal fluctuations cause these to pinch in cases where a perturbed cylinder would be stable deterministically. Finally we show that the fluctuating hydrodynamics model can be applied to study a broader range of surface-tension driven phenomena.},

  abstract = {Lattice Boltzmann equations for the isothermal Navier-Stokes equations have been constructed systematically using a truncated moment expansion of the equilibrium distribution function from continuum kinetic theory. Applied to the shallow water equations, with its different equation of state, the same approach yields discrete equilibria that are subject to a grid scale computational instability. Different and stable equilibria were previously constructed by Salmon [J. Marine Res. 57, 503 (1999)]. The two sets of equilibria differ through a nonhydrodynamic or ``ghost'' mode that has no direct effect on the hydrodynamic behavior derived in the slowly varying limit. However, Salmon's equilibria eliminate a coupling between hydrodynamic and ghost modes, one that leads to instability with a growth rate increasing with wave number. Previous work has usually assumed that truncated moment expansions lead to stable schemes. Such instabilities have implications for lattice Boltzmann equations that simulate other nonideal equations of state, or that simulate fully compressible, nonisothermal fluids using additional particles.},

By isolating the effect of van der Waals interactions for nanoscale rivulets, and of gravity for macrosize rivulets, we are able to analyze the influence of these forces on the stability. We discuss in detail the scaling of the emerging wavelengths (distance between drops formed after the breakup process) with the rivulet cross-sectional area. Perhaps surprisingly, we uncover close connection between this scaling and the one for the breakup of a free-space fluid jet (Rayleigh--Plateau instability). Finally, we consider rivulets of finite length and find that the finite size effects are considerably different from the ones obtained previously for semi-infinite fluid films.},

We find the stability regions for given area of the cross section of the rivulet, A, plane inclination angle, {$\alpha$}, and static contact angle, {\texttheta}0, characterizing the wettability of the substrate. For {$\alpha$}'s smaller than some critical angle, {$\alpha$}*, a static solution exists. This solution is characterized by rear/front contact angles given by {\texttheta}0 {\textpm} {$\delta$}. The linear stability analysis of this solution is performed using an efficient pseudo-spectral Chebyshev method. We analyze the effects of A, {\texttheta}0, and {$\alpha$} on the predictions of the model, such as the dominant wavelength, the maximum growth rate, and the behavior of the most unstable perturbation mode. To verify them, we also carry out experiments with silicone oils spreading on a coated glass substrate for several different fluid volumes and inclination angles. We find very good agreement between the wavelength of maximum growth rate given by the theory and the average distance between the drops after rivulet breakup. An analysis of finite size effects shows that the inclusion of normal gravity effects leads to a better agreement between theoretical and experimental results.},

  abstract = {Wetting and dewetting are both fundamental modes of motion of liquids on solid surfaces. They are critically important for processes in biology, chemistry, and engineering, such as drying, coating, and lubrication. However, recent progress in wetting, which has led to new fields such as superhydrophobicity and liquid marbles, has not been matched by dewetting. A significant problem has been the inability to study the model system of a uniform film dewetting from a nonwetting surface to a single macroscopic droplet---a barrier that does not exist for the reverse wetting process of a droplet spreading into a film. We report the dewetting of a dielectrophoresis-induced film into a single equilibrium droplet. The emergent picture of the full dewetting dynamics is of an initial regime, where a liquid rim recedes at constant speed and constant dynamic contact angle, followed by a relatively short exponential relaxation of a spherical cap shape. This sharply contrasts with the reverse wetting process, where a spreading droplet follows a smooth sequence of spherical cap shapes. Complementary numerical simulations and a hydrodynamic model reveal a local dewetting mechanism driven by the equilibrium contact angle, where contact line slip dominates the dewetting dynamics. Our conclusions can be used to understand a wide variety of processes involving liquid dewetting, such as drop rebound, condensation, and evaporation. In overcoming the barrier to studying single film-to-droplet dewetting, our results provide new approaches to fluid manipulation and uses of dewetting, such as inducing films of prescribed initial shapes and slip-controlled liquid retraction.},

Hence experimental studies visualize and characterize the increase in size over time for drops spreading over substrates, or liquid bridges between coalescing drops, or the decrease in the radius of pinching necks during drop formation. Even for Newtonian fluids, the interplay of inertial, viscous, and capillary stresses can lead to a number of scaling laws, with three limiting self-similar cases: visco-inertial (VI), visco-capillary (VC) and inertio-capillary (IC). Though experiments are presented as examples of the methods of dimensional analysis, the lack of precise values or estimates for pre-factors, transitions, and scaling exponents presents difficulties for quantitative analysis and material characterization. In this tutorial review, we reanalyze and summarize an elaborate set of landmark published experimental studies on a wide range of Newtonian fluids. We show that moving beyond VI, VC, and IC units in favor of intrinsic timescale and lengthscale determined by all three material properties (viscosity, surface tension and density), creates a complementary system that we call the Ohnesorge units. We find that in spite of large differences in topological features, timescales, and material properties, the analysis of spreading, pinching and coalescing drops in the Ohnesorge units results in a remarkable collapse of the experimental datasets, highlighting the shared and universal features displayed in such flows.},

We discuss the conditions under which a static equilibrium of the ring is possible in the presence of contact angle hysteresis. A linear stability analysis (LSA) of this equilibrium solution is carried out by using a slip model to account for the contact line divergence. The LSA provides specific predictions regarding the evolution of unstable modes. In order to describe the evolution of the ring for longer times, a quasi-static approximation is implemented. This approach assumes a quasi-static evolution and takes into account the concomitant variation of the instantaneous growth rates of the modes responsible for either collapse of the ring into a single central drop or breakup into a number of droplets along the ring periphery. We compare the results of the LSA and the quasi-static model approach with those obtained from nonlinear numerical simulations using a complementary disjoining pressure model. We find remarkably good agreement between the predictions of the two models regarding the expected number of drops forming during the breakup process.},

Light is a fascinating and green stimulus because of its remote control, micron- or submicron-sized focusing area with controllable wavelength and energy, non-invasiveness and non-destructive nature, precisely controlled direction, and availability. In this review, we have emphasized on and summarized the most recent observations and efforts in the progress of photoswitchable spiropyran-based materials and their applications as sensors for heavy metal cations, anions, pH, acid and base vapors, wettability and humidity. Other items include data recording and anticounterfeiting devices, photorheological fluids, optically reversible switching membranes, photoregulating surface plasmon resonance, photomodulation of ion conductivity and mechanoresponsive polymers. The bio-based field is another interesting subject that is discussed here and consists of reversible cell sheet engineering, photodynamic therapy, switchable fluorescence labeling, controlled drug delivery and biological ion channels. On the other hand, limited light penetration inside the living tissues and hazards of high-energy ultraviolet irradiation for initiating photochemical transformations have limited the use of such light-controlled systems in medicinal and therapeutic means. Those spiropyran-based materials which are susceptible to being triggered by low energy near IR (NIR) two-photon light irradiation and upconversion nanoparticles are recently under serious explorations and have been reviewed as a new perspective for their advanced applications.},

We assume that mass flows by diffusion along the film surface and that local equilibrium holds. We find that for non-zero contact angles there is a finite range of perturbation wavenumbers in the axial direction which correspond to instability and will potentially lead to agglomeration of the line of film. All unstable perturbations are of the varicose (sausage) type. The presence of the substrate is stabilizing; the range of unstable wavelengths is always less than that of a freely-suspended circular cylinder with the same volume and decreases to zero width at zero contact angle. The maximum growth rate of the instability varies strongly with the contact angle and approaches zero as the contact angle approaches zero. Our results agree qualitatively with the experimentally observed wavelength and growth rates of the instability.},

We show that the capillary wave initially grows linearly as on a straight thread. The axial curvature decreases the growth rate of the capillary waves while the external flow enhances it. Breakup depends on the competition of two time scales: one for torus retraction and the other for neck pinch-off. The outcome is determined by the initial amplitude of the disturbance, the thickness of the torus relative to its circumference, and the torus-to-medium viscosity ratio. The linearly dominant mode may not persist till nonlinear growth and breakup. The numerical results are generally consistent with experimental observations.},

  abstract = {In this article, we experimentally investigate the nonlinear behaviour of a viscoplastic film flow down an inclined plane. We focus on the nonlinear instabilities that appear as roll waves. Roll waves are generated by perturbing a permanent flow of Herschel--Bulkley fluid (Carbopol 980) at low frequencies. To determine the local thickness of the film, we used a laser sensor and a camera to globally capture the transverse shape of the waves. For a regular forcing, the results show the existence of different regimes. First, we observe primary instabilities below the cut-off frequency at the entrance of the channel. After the exponential growth of the wave in the linear regime, we recognise the nonlinear dynamics with the existence of finite amplitude waves. This finite amplitude depends on the frequency, the Reynolds number and the inclination angle. The results show that this instability is supercritical. At moderate Reynolds numbers, the finite 2-D waves become sensitive to transverse perturbations, due to a secondary instability, and become 3-D waves. The experimental results illustrate a phenomenology of viscoplastic film flows similar to Newtonian fluids, except for the capillary waves.},

  abstract = {Wetting of solid surfaces by liquid deposition, contact dispensing, drop transfer, collision of wet particles, or during coating processes is often accompanied by the formation of liquid bridges between two or more solid substrates. They appear in many applications, like material science, microfluidics, biomedical, chemical, or aerospace engineering, and different fields of physics. In this study, the flows accompanying lifting of a Hele-Shaw cell, stretching or shearing of a liquid bridge, as well as liquid bridge flows observed during printing processes and other important applications, are briefly reviewed. Such flows are governed by surface tension, inertia, stresses associated with the liquid rheology, and forces caused by the substrate's wettability. Instabilities of liquid bridges lead to the formation of finger-like structures on the substrate or the appearance of cavities at the wetted region of the wall. The time required for jet pinch-off also determines~the residual liquid volume on both solid bodies.},

When the volume of the moving upper layer is sufficiently small, the motionless lower layer outcrops over a broad area of the northern wind gyre, and the pattern of separated and isolated western boundary currents agrees with the theory of Veronis (1973). Because planetary geostrophic dynamics omit inertia, lattice Boltzmann solutions of the planetary geostrophic equations do not require a lattice with the high degree of symmetry needed to correctly represent the Reynolds stress. This property gives planetary geostrophic dynamics a significant computational advantage over the primitive equations, especially in three dimensions.},

  abstract = {In this study, we investigate the stability of a liquid film that partially wets a corner between a cylinder and a substrate, using a combination of theoretical and numerical approaches. The film stability, which depends on the film size and the wall wettability, is firstly predicted by a standard linear stability analysis (LSA) within the long-wave theoretical framework. We find that the film size plays the most important role in controlling the film stability. Specifically, the thinner the film is, the more sensitive it becomes to the large-wavenumber perturbation. The wall wettability mainly impacts the growth rates of perturbations and slightly influences the marginal stability and post-instability patterns of wrapping films. We compare the LSA predictions with numerical results obtained from a disjoining pressure model (DPM) and Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) simulations, which provide more insights into the film breakup process. At the early stage there is a strong agreement between the LSA predictions and the DPM results. Notably, as the perturbation grows, thin film regions connecting two neighboring satellite droplets form which may eventually lead to a stable or temporary secondary droplet, an aspect which the LSA is incapable of capturing. In addition, the VOF simulations suggest that beyond a critical film size the crest coalescence mechanism becomes involved during the breakup stage. Therefore, the LSA predictions are able to provide only an upper limit on the final number of satellite droplets.},

Reversible switching among multiple wetting states between superhydrophobicity and superhydrophilicity can be realized by synergistic regulation of surface microstructure based on stretching-recovery shape memory effect and surface chemical composition based on O2 plasma-heating. The mild and excellent water-responsive shape memory ability of substrate enables surface microstructure and corresponding wetting to fix at desirable states without keeping continuous external force or stimuli, which is superior to elastomer substrate, responsive molecule modification, or traditional temperature/light triggered shape memory materials. Given the flexibility and versatility, we show its applications in smart platform for creating gradient wettability and patterned micro-reaction.},

The resultant length scale was correlated to the transport and instability growths that occur during the liquid lifetime of the melted copper rings. For 13-nm-thick rings, a change in the nanoparticle spacing with the ring width is attributed to a transition from a Raleigh-Plateau instability to a thin film instability because of competition between the cumulative transport and instability timescales. To explore the competition between instability mechanisms further, we carried out experiments with 7-nm-thick rings. In agreement with the theoretical predictions, these rings break up in both the azimuthal and radial directions, confirming that a simple hydrodynamic model captures the main features of the processes leading to the breakup.},

We outline the basic features of the method, show in which limits the expected thin-film equations are recovered, and perform validation tests. The numerical scheme is applied to the viscous Rayleigh-Taylor instability of a thin film and to the spreading of a sessile drop toward its equilibrium contact angle configuration. We show that the Cox-Voinov law is satisfied and that the effect of a tunable slip length on the substrate is correctly captured. We address, then, the problem of a droplet sliding on an inclined plane, finding that the Capillary number scales linearly with the Bond number, in agreement with experimental results. At last, we demonstrate the ability of the method to handle heterogenous and complex systems by showcasing the controlled dewetting of a thin film on a chemically structured substrate.},
