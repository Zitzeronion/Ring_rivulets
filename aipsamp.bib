  abstract = {In the course of miniaturization of electronic and microfluidic devices, reliable predictions of the stability of ultrathin films have a strategic role for design purposes. Consequently, efficient computational techniques that allow for a direct comparison with experiment become increasingly important. Here we demonstrate, for the first time, that the full complex spatial and temporal evolution of the rupture of ultrathin films can be modelled in quantitative agreement with experiment. We accomplish this by combining highly controlled experiments on different film-rupture patterns with computer simulations using novel numerical schemes for thin-film equations. For the quantitative comparison of the pattern evolution in both experiment and simulation we introduce a novel pattern analysis method based on Minkowski measures. Our results are fundamental for the development of efficient tools capable of describing essential aspects of thin-film flow in technical systems.},

  abstract = {Wetting phenomena are ubiquitous in nature and technology. A solid substrate exposed to the environment is almost invariably covered by a layer of fluid material. In this review, the surface forces that lead to wetting are considered, and the equilibrium surface coverage of a substrate in contact with a drop of liquid. Depending on the nature of the surface forces involved, different scenarios for wetting phase transitions are possible; recent progress allows us to relate the critical exponents directly to the nature of the surface forces which lead to the different wetting scenarios. Thermal fluctuation effects, which can be greatly enhanced for wetting of geometrically or chemically structured substrates, and are much stronger in colloidal suspensions, modify the adsorption singularities. Macroscopic descriptions and microscopic theories have been developed to understand and predict wetting behavior relevant to microfluidics and nanofluidics applications. Then the dynamics of wetting is examined. A drop, placed on a substrate which it wets, spreads out to form a film. Conversely, a nonwetted substrate previously covered by a film dewets upon an appropriate change of system parameters. The hydrodynamics of both wetting and dewetting is influenced by the presence of the three-phase contact line separating ``wet'' regions from those that are either dry or covered by a microscopic film only. Recent theoretical, experimental, and numerical progress in the description of moving contact line dynamics are reviewed, and its relation to the thermodynamics of wetting is explored. In addition, recent progress on rough surfaces is surveyed. The anchoring of contact lines and contact angle hysteresis are explored resulting from surface inhomogeneities. Further, new ways to mold wetting characteristics according to technological constraints are discussed, for example, the use of patterned surfaces, surfactants, or complex fluids.},

Moreover, the thermal-responsive wettability and adhesion to oil at the water/solid interface can be tailored by designing and constructing ordered micro-structures on the surface. We demonstrated the thermal-responsive changing of the topography on PNIPAM hydrogel surface by atomic force microscopy and proposed a mechanism of inter-molecular to intra-molecular hydrogen binding transitions.

We briefly compare the governing physics in each system, and how to control the wrinkle pattern order, characteristic wavelength and amplitude, orientation and interactions under different geometrical confinements.

Thin film flows occur over a wide range of length scales and are central to numerous areas of engineering, geophysics, and biophysics; these include nanofluidics and microfluidics, coating flows, intensive processing, lava flows, dynamics of continental ice sheets, tear-film rupture, and surfactant replacement therapy. These flows have attracted considerable attention in the literature, which have resulted in many significant developments in experimental, analytical, and numerical research in this area. These include advances in understanding dewetting, thermocapillary- and surfactant-driven films, falling films and films flowing over structured, compliant, and rapidly rotating substrates, and evaporating films as well as those manipulated via use of electric fields to produce nanoscale patterns. These developments are reviewed in this paper and open problems and exciting research avenues in this thriving area of fluid mechanics are also highlighted.},

By isolating the effect of van der Waals interactions for nanoscale rivulets, and of gravity for macrosize rivulets, we are able to analyze the influence of these forces on the stability. We discuss in detail the scaling of the emerging wavelengths (distance between drops formed after the breakup process) with the rivulet cross-sectional area. Perhaps surprisingly, we uncover close connection between this scaling and the one for the breakup of a free-space fluid jet (Rayleigh--Plateau instability). Finally, we consider rivulets of finite length and find that the finite size effects are considerably different from the ones obtained previously for semi-infinite fluid films.},

The study is performed within the framework of lubrication approximation by employing a slip model. Both normal and parallel components of gravity are considered. We find the stability regions for given area of the cross section of the rivulet, A, plane inclination angle, {$\alpha$}, and static contact angle, {\texttheta}0, characterizing the wettability of the substrate. For {$\alpha$}'s smaller than some critical angle, {$\alpha$}*, a static solution exists. This solution is characterized by rear/front contact angles given by {\texttheta}0 {\textpm} {$\delta$}. The linear stability analysis of this solution is performed using an efficient pseudo-spectral Chebyshev method. We analyze the effects of A, {\texttheta}0, and {$\alpha$} on the predictions of the model, such as the dominant wavelength, the maximum growth rate, and the behavior of the most unstable perturbation mode. To verify them, we also carry out experiments with silicone oils spreading on a coated glass substrate for several different fluid volumes and inclination angles. We find very good agreement between the wavelength of maximum growth rate given by the theory and the average distance between the drops after rivulet breakup. An analysis of finite size effects shows that the inclusion of normal gravity effects leads to a better agreement between theoretical and experimental results.},

When the filament is resting on a flat solid surface which imposes wetting conditions the subtle interplay with the fluid dynamics makes the instability pathways and mode selection difficult to predict. Here, we show how controlling the static and dynamic wetting of a surface can lead to repeatable switching between a toroidal film of an electrically insulating liquid and patterns of droplets of well-defined dimensions confined to a ring geometry. Mode selection between instability pathways to these different final states is achieved by dielectrophoresis forces selectively polarising the dipoles at the solid-liquid interface and so changing both the mobility of the contact line and the partial wetting of the topologically distinct liquid domains. Our results provide insights into the wetting and stability of shaped liquid filaments in simple and complex geometries relevant to applications ranging from printing to digital microfluidic devices.},

From the profile of a retracting liquid front (e.g., measured with atomic force microscopy), the slip length can be extracted with the help of a Stokes model for a thin liquid film dewetting from a solid substrate. Specifically, we use a lubrication model derived from the Stokes model for strong slippage and linearize the film profile around the flat, unperturbed film. For small slip lengths, we expand the linearized full Stokes model for small slopes up to third order. Using the respective model, we obtain, in addition to the slip length, the capillary number, from which we can estimate the viscosity of the fluid film. We compare numerical and experimental results, test the consistency and the validity of the models/approximations, and give an easy-to-follow guide of how they can be used to analyze experiments.},

Those implementations benefit from a broad range of fabrication methods that are partly adopted from well-established macroscale processes or are completely new and promising. In addition, thin and flexible foils enable various features like low thermal resistance for efficient thermocycling or integration of easily deformable chambers paving the way for new means of on-chip reagent storage or fluid transport. From an economical perspective, Lab-on-a-Foil systems are characterised by low material consumption and often low-cost materials which are attractive for cost-effective high-volume fabrication of self-contained disposable chips. The first part of this review focuses on available materials, fabrication processes and approaches for integration of microfluidic functions including liquid control and transport as well as storage and release of reagents. In the second part, an analysis of the state of Lab-on-a-Foil applications is provided with a special focus on nucleic acid analysis, immunoassays, cell-based assays and home care testing.

A linear stability analysis (LSA) of this equilibrium solution is carried out by using a slip model to account for the contact line divergence. The LSA provides specific predictions regarding the evolution of unstable modes. In order to describe the evolution of the ring for longer times, a quasi-static approximation is implemented. This approach assumes a quasi-static evolution and takes into account the concomitant variation of the instantaneous growth rates of the modes responsible for either collapse of the ring into a single central drop or breakup into a number of droplets along the ring periphery. We compare the results of the LSA and the quasi-static model approach with those obtained from nonlinear numerical simulations using a complementary disjoining pressure model. We find remarkably good agreement between the predictions of the two models regarding the expected number of drops forming during the breakup process.},

We studied various fundamental and applied aspects of equilibrium liquid surface morphologies both theoretically and experimentally. Our theoretical analysis showed that surface profiles on homogeneous surfaces display a diverging curvature in the vicinity of the three phase contact line. The asymptotic contact angle at the contact line is equal to Young's angle, independent of the applied voltage. With respect to the morphology of the liquid surface, contact angle variations achieved by electrowetting are equivalent to those achieved by varying the chemical nature of the substrates, except for electric field-induced distortions in a region close to the contact line. Experimentally, we studied the (global) morphology of liquid microstructure substrates with stripe-shaped electrodes. As the local contact angle is reduced by increasing the applied voltage, liquid droplets elongate along the stripe axis as expected. For droplets on a single surface with a stripe electrode, there is a discontinuous morphological transition where elongated droplets transform into translationally invariant cylinder segments with the contact line pinned along the stripe edge and vice versa. If the liquid is confined between two parallel surfaces with parallel stripe electrodes, the elongation of the droplet and its transformation into a translationally invariant morphology with pinned contact lines is continuous. Experimental results are compared to analytical and numerical models.},

The motion of the dewetting front shows transitions from being nearly linear in time for no-slip to t2/3 as the slip is increased. For much larger slip lengths the front motion appears to become linear again. Correspondingly, the dewetting profiles undergo a transition from oscillatory to monotone decay into the uniform film layer for large slip. Increasing the slip further, to very large values, is associated with an increasing degree of asymmetry in the structure of the dewetting ridge profile},

  abstract = {Macroscopic thin liquid films are entities that are important in biophysics, physics, and engineering, as well as in natural settings. They can be composed of common liquids such as water or oil, rheologically complex materials such as polymers solutions or melts, or complex mixtures of phases or components. When the films are subjected to the action of various mechanical, thermal, or structural factors, they display interesting dynamic phenomena such as wave propagation, wave steepening, and development of chaotic responses. Such films can display rupture phenomena creating holes, spreading of fronts, and the development of fingers. In this review a unified mathematical theory is presented that takes advantage of the disparity of the length scales and is based on the asymptotic procedure of reduction of the full set of governing equations and boundary conditions to a simplified, highly nonlinear, evolution equation or to a set of equations. As a result of this long-wave theory, a mathematical system is obtained that does not have the mathematical complexity of the original free-boundary problem but does preserve many of the important features of its physics. The basics of the long-wave theory are explained. If, in addition, the Reynolds number of the flow is not too large, the analogy with Reynolds's theory of lubrication can be drawn. A general nonlinear evolution equation or equations are then derived and various particular cases are considered. Each case contains a discussion of the linear stability properties of the base-state solutions and of the nonlinear spatiotemporal evolution of the interface (and other scalar variables, such as temperature or solute concentration). The cases reducing to a single highly nonlinear evolution equation are first examined. These include: (a) films with constant interfacial shear stress and constant surface tension, (b) films with constant surface tension and gravity only, (c) films with van der Waals (long-range molecular) forces and constant surface tension only, (d) films with thermocapillarity, surface tension, and body force only, (e) films with temperature-dependent physical properties, (f) evaporating/condensing films, (g) films on a thick substrate, (h) films on a horizontal cylinder, and (i) films on a rotating disc. The dynamics of the films with a spatial dependence of the base-state solution are then studied. These include the examples of nonuniform temperature or heat flux at liquid-solid boundaries. Problems which reduce to a set of nonlinear evolution equations are considered next. Those include (a) the dynamics of free liquid films, (b) bounded films with interfacial viscosity, and (c) dynamics of soluble and insoluble surfactants in bounded and free films. The spreading of drops on a solid surface and moving contact lines, including effects of heat and mass transport and van der Waals attractions, are then addressed. Several related topics such as falling films and sheets and Hele-Shaw flows are also briefly discussed. The results discussed give motivation for the development of careful experiments which can be used to test the theories and exhibit new phenomena.},

  abstract = {Thin polymer films on hydrophobic substrates are susceptible to rupture and hole formation. This, in turn, initiates a complex dewetting process, which ultimately leads to characteristic droplet patterns. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest that the type of droplet pattern depends on the specific interfacial condition between the polymer and the substrate. Predicting the morphological evolution over long timescales and on the different length scales involved is a major computational challenge. In this study, a highly adaptive numerical scheme is presented, which allows for following the dewetting process deep into the nonlinear regime of the model equations and captures the complex dynamics, including the shedding of droplets. In addition, our numerical results predict the previously unknown shedding of satellite droplets during the destabilization of liquid ridges that form during the late stages of the dewetting process. While the formation of satellite droplets is well known in the context of elongating fluid filaments and jets, we show here that, for dewetting liquid ridges, this property can be dramatically altered by the interfacial condition between polymer and substrate, namely slip. This work shows how dissipative processes can be used to systematically tune the formation of patterns.},

  abstract = {In numerous solution-processed thin films, a complex morphology resulting from liquid--liquid phase separation (LLPS) or from polycrystallization arises during the drying or subsequent processing steps. The morphology has a strong influence on the performance of the final device but unfortunately, the process--structure relationship is often poorly and only qualitatively understood. This is because many different physical mechanisms (miscibility, evaporation, crystallization, diffusion, and advection) are active at potentially different time scales and because the kinetics plays a crucial role: the morphology develops until it is kinetically quenched far from equilibrium. In order to unravel the various possible structure formation pathways, a unified theoretical framework that takes into account all these physical phenomena is proposed. This phase-field simulation tool is based on the Cahn--Hilliard equations for diffusion and the Allen--Cahn equation for crystallization and evaporation, which are coupled to the equations for the dynamics of the fluid. The behavior of the coupled model based on simple test cases is discussed and verified. Furthermore, how this framework allows to investigate the morphology formation in a drying film undergoing evaporation-induced LLPS and crystallization, which is typically a situation encountered, is illustrated, for example, in organic photovoltaics applications.},

The contact angle is a prescribed function of position on the substrate. An evolution equation is presented, using the lubrication approximation, that includes viscous, capillary, disjoining, and gravitational forces. Motion to and from dry substrate regions is made possible by use of a thin energetically stable wetting layer. Axisymmetric spreading on a uniform substrate is calculated, and it is found, in agreement with reported experiments, that spreading rates are independent of the contact angle until the drop has almost stabilized. We simulate motion on a heterogeneous substrate composed of two different materials having widely different contact angles. Motion proceeds in an almost discontinuous fashion as the initial droplet breaks up into smaller pieces through the action of the wetting forces. Various forms of the disjoining energy functional are employed; the particular choice is found to have only a limited quantitative effect of the drop dynamics. Experimental observations confirm the basic features of the simulation, although a time-scale correction needs to be applied.},

However, above a certain size individual sliding drops are unstable and break up into smaller drops. Therefore, the long-time dynamics of a large drop ensemble is governed by a balance of merging and splitting. We employ a long-wave film height evolution equation and determine the dynamics of the drop size distribution towards a stationary state from direct numerical simulations on large domains. The main features of the distribution are then related to the bifurcation diagram of individual drops obtained by numerical path continuation. The gained knowledge allows us to develop a Smoluchowski-type statistical model for the ensemble dynamics that well compares to full direct simulations.},

For 13-nm-thick rings, a change in the nanoparticle spacing with the ring width is attributed to a transition from a Raleigh-Plateau instability to a thin film instability because of competition between the cumulative transport and instability timescales. To explore the competition between instability mechanisms further, we carried out experiments with 7-nm-thick rings. In agreement with the theoretical predictions, these rings break up in both the azimuthal and radial directions, confirming that a simple hydrodynamic model captures the main features of the processes leading to the breakup.},

Chemical composition and surface topography are the two key factors in the wettability of solid substrates. Applying external stimuli and exchanging counterions of ionic liquids and polyelectrolyte films are valuable approaches for rendering the change in surface chemistry and/or topography, and for driving the transition between hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity of surfaces. Through the combination of stimuli-responsive films and micro-/nanostructural surfaces, smart surfaces with reversible switching between superhydrophobicity and superhydrophilicity have been achieved. As an important advancement in reversibly switchable wettability, this review briefly introduces ionic liquids (ILs) as on--off systems to obtain reversibly switchable wettability and then discusses in more detail the methods to induce the reversibly switchable wettability of surfaces modified by ILs, additives, or thin films. In addition to reversibly switchable wettability mechanisms, open problems and potential solutions are discussed (157 references).}
